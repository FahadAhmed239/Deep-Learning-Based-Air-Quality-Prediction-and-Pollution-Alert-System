Deep-Learning-Based-Air-Quality-Prediction-and-Pollution-Alert-System
Deep Learning project to predict air quality index (AQI) and generate pollution alerts.


## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a **Deep Learning model** for predicting Air Quality Index (AQI) and pollutant levels to provide **early alerts** for pollution control. By analyzing historical pollution and weather data, the model will predict future air quality conditions and generate warnings when pollution exceeds safe thresholds.

##  Dataset Information

- **Source:**
  - [OpenAQ](https://openaq.org/)
  - [Kaggle: Air Quality & Pollution Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/air-quality-data-in-india)
- **Features:**
  - PM2.5, PM10, NOâ‚‚, SOâ‚‚, CO, Oâ‚ƒ
  - Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed
- **Target Variable:**
  - AQI (Air Quality Index)

The dataset used here (`dataset/air_quality_dataset.csv`) is a sample generated for demonstration purposes.

---

##  AI / Deep Learning Approach
- Preprocessing: Handling missing values, normalization
- Models: Deep Neural Network (DNN), LSTM for time-series AQI prediction
- Output: Predicted AQI values and pollution alert system

---

##  Expected Outcomes
- Accurate AQI predictions
- Classification into categories: Good, Moderate, Poor, Very Poor, Hazardous
- Early-warning pollution alert system for smart cities

---

##  Progress (30% Submission)
- Dataset collected and added to repository (`dataset/air_quality_dataset.csv`)
- Initial data exploration completed (`notebooks/data_exploration.ipynb`)

---

##  Next Steps
1. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2. Train deep learning models
3. Evaluate prediction accuracy
4. Build pollution alert dashboard
